#### Inital

##### Random
- Upload to github 25.04.2024 - 10:15am
- phpinfo.php file added to about php version check
- install php8.2-fpm and configured with nginx

#### Issue two
- Index page total order amount, cash and credit showing

##### Random
- Problem was session 'user_name' undefined after solved Issue two, becasue we are not logged in not checked the login page
- Found the header user logged status depend on session type, it's make condition based without logged in show guest mode
- Not testing the login page, now trying to serially task and if error critical try to resolving without session bypass, means if my change will impact on logged user and accessable to without login then avoid this error, first priority is Issue serial


### Login error solving
- I think first solve the login error and comment the sesstion type and user_name cause, i need to access the home page with login not guest, issue one and two solved but I need properly so, randomly solving the login issue which is not mention the issue list, login error are showing, and solving for best practice with proper session data and menu visible.
